                    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>
                    <p>We may change this privacy policy from time-to-time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this privacy policy (in some cases, if we make significant changes to this privacy policy, we may provide you with additional notice by adding a statement to our homepage, or by sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.</p>
                    <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
